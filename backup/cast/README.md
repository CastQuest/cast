# CASTQUEST V3  
### Autonomous Multi‑Chain Creative Economy

CASTQUEST V3 is the first public stable release of the CASTQUEST Protocol — a fully autonomous, multi‑chain creative economy powered by AI builders, agents, L3 chains, a global marketplace, sponsorship economy, and an extensible governance + treasury system.

This repository contains the complete CASTQUEST V3 implementation:

- **Next.js V3 UI/UX system** (App Router + Tailwind + ShadCN)
- **Full contract suite** (CAST, QUEST, MEDIA, FRAM, GAME, CODE, SponsorToken, GovernanceV2, SubDAOs, L3, Marketplace, Auctions, Sponsorship)
- **AI Builders** (Code, Frame, Game, UI)
- **Agents** (Creation, Frame, Game, Pricing, Auction, Curation, Fraud, Sync, UI, Portfolio, Social Automation)
- **SDK** (typed, deterministic, multi‑chain aware)
- **Indexers** (MC indexer, buyback indexer, social indexer)
- **Bots** (Farcaster, Reddit, X, Discord, Telegram)
- **Docs‑Site** (full protocol documentation, V1→V2→V3 migration guides)
- **Infra** (orchestration, CI/CD, deployment)

## 🚀 Vision

CASTQUEST V3 enables creators, sponsors, and agents to coordinate through:

- Multi‑chain assets  
- AI‑assisted creation  
- Autonomous treasury + yield  
- Global multi‑chain marketplace  
- L3 creator chains  
- Sponsor economy  
- SubDAOs  
- AI DAO governance  

Everything is deterministic, indexer‑verified, and designed for long‑term autonomy.
